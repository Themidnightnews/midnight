"""
The news sources. Each entry is (site name, RSS/Atom feed URL, section slug).

The section slug is one of the Midnight sections in sections.json, so every
article lands in the section its feed belongs to. Sites with several feeds
(BBC, Guardian, NYT, NPR...) appear once per section but count as ONE site in
the rotation's "site" count.

Feed URLs move around. A dead feed is never fatal: it is logged, skipped for
that pass, and retried on the next one. Add/remove lines freely.
