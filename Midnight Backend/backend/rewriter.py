Rewrites a scraped article into an original article with the Groq API.

Output is plain delimited text (not JSON, which broke on escaping), and the
reply must end with a ===END=== marker and a normal finish_reason. A reply
that was cut off (credits ran out, token limit, network) is REJECTED here and
never turns into an article. See quality.py for the full set of checks.

article below. Use your own words and sentence structure; do not copy sentences verbatim.

STRICT FACTUAL RULES. A fact-checker will compare your article to the source line by line and
reject it if it breaks any of these:
- Every name, role, number, score, date, place, quotation and claim must come from the source
  material. If the source does not say it, leave it out, even if you believe it is true.
- Do not add background, history, relationships between people, motives or context that the
  source does not state.
- Do not put words in quotation marks unless they appear word for word in the source.
- Your voice shapes tone and emphasis only. Any opinion must be clearly framed as the writer's
  view and must not assert a new fact.
- If the source is thin, write a shorter article. Never fill gaps with invented detail.

Source title: {article['title']}
Source material:
{source_text}

Formatting style for this article: {voice['formatting']}. Inside the body, use
only these HTML tags: <p>, <b>, <i>, <strong>, <em>, <h3>, <ul>, <li>. Do not
use markdown syntax like ** or * — use the actual HTML tags instead. Do not
include <html>, <body>, or any wrapper tags. Finish every paragraph and end
the article with a complete concluding sentence.

{length_instruction}

IMPORTANCE scores how much this story matters to a general reader today, judged on the
source material only: 85-100 = major world-changing or market-moving event (war, election
result, big policy change, disaster, major market or tech shift); 60-84 = significant news
with wide impact; 35-59 = ordinary news of interest to some readers; 10-34 = minor,
niche, routine or feature material; 0-9 = trivial. Sports results, entertainment gossip,
lifestyle and product-review pieces are rarely above 40 unless something truly exceptional
happened. Be strict: most stories should score between 20 and 70.

SECTIONS: choose where this story belongs on the site, using ONLY the slugs below. Pick 1 to 3,
most relevant first. Add a second or third only if the story genuinely belongs there too. Judge
by what the story is ABOUT, not where it was published. Prefer the most specific section: a
football match is "sport", a chip launch is "tech". Use "world" only for international affairs
that fit no more specific section.
